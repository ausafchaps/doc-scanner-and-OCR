# doc-scanner-and-OCR

The goal of this project is to develop a document scanner and 
text detector using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, 
and PyTesseract, a Python wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine. The 
document scanner will be able to take an image of a document and 
automatically straighten and crop it to remove any excess 
background. The text detector will then be able to identify and extract 
any text present in the document image.
